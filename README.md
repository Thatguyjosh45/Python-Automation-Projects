# To-Do List
To-Do List Management:

You can view tasks, add new tasks, or mark tasks as done.
Each task is added with a number, making it easy to identify them.
Reminder Feature:

The script can send you an email reminder every day at a set time (e.g., 9:00 AM).
This will list your tasks or remind you if you don't have any tasks.
Email Sending:

This uses Pythonâ€™s smtplib to send emails.
Make sure you replace the your_email@example.com, your_password, and smtp.example.com with actual values. You can use services like Gmail or others that support SMTP.
